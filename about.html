        I was born and raised in California. I received my BA in Music from the
        University of California at Berkeley, and my Ph.D. in Music Theory from
        the University of California at Santa Barbara. From there, I have taught
        at the National University of Singapore, Northeastern University (in
        Boston), the University of Denver, the University of Texas at
        Brownsville, and now Texas A&M University Corpus Christi.

        I am a beach girl, and I love Corpus Christi. I love the weather, the
        beach, my students, and the people. Two of my favorite things to do are
        to play beach volleyball and to run on the beach.

        In addition to exercise, I am very passionate about animals, animal
        rights, and veganism. I eat a plant-based diet and I do not use any
        animal products. I found that eating plant based has changed my life in
        so many positive ways, that the only thing I wish is that I had become
        vegan earlier.

        Although the main reason I chose to be vegan is for the animals, it has
        benefitted my health in a number of ways. Before I was vegan, my
        cholesterol was 231. In fact, my entire family is on Lipitor (a
        cholesterol med). Since becoming vegan in 2012, my cholesterol has been
        dropping every year, and now it is a healthy 139.
